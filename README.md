## Description

The "Annual Accounting" program is a simple and lightweight accounting software coded in Python that provides a quick overview of money inflows and outflows for each month.

### Features

- The software consists of a table listing the 12 months of the year, where you can enter amounts for positive or negative integers, as well as numbers with up to two decimal places.
- You can enter up to 2X30 amounts per month.
- Beneath each month, at the bottom of the two columns composing them, you can leave a comment in the form of "text."
- Simply click the "Add" button to update the table and obtain the total amount for each month.
- To calculate the total amount for the year, click on the "Calculate Annual Total" button.
- You can save and load your tables with different amounts either through the buttons on the left side of the table or through the top menu bar under the "File" tab.
- Table data is saved and loaded from .JSON files.
- The "Tools" tab allows you to choose either exporting the table data to a "PDF" file or to an "EXCEL" file for users who have a "Microsoft Office" license.
- The "Shortcuts" tab contains a list of keyboard shortcuts that can be used, and the "Help" tab contains a brief program description.

## Target Audience

The aim of this program is to be user-friendly, enabling a wide audience to use it, regardless of their level of accounting knowledge. The options provided by this program are very basic but allow for a quick overview of all money inflows and outflows.

The advantage of this program is that the "Export to Excel" option allows individuals with basic Excel knowledge to have direct access to all the data entered and generated by the table on a first Excel sheet called "Detailed Accounting."

This enables more experienced individuals to create other tables or statistical studies based on the data already entered in the generated Excel sheet. Additionally, there's also a histogram generated on a second Excel sheet called "Graphical Accounting" for those who don't know how to create a table and wish to have a graphical representation of their annual expenses.

## Installation (for Windows computer, 64-bit operating system, and x64 processor)

This is a portable installation that can be used directly without administrator rights. To use this application, navigate to the "Accounting" folder, then double-click the "Accounting.exe" file. The program will launch directly without any additional actions.
